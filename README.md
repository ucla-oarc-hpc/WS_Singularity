Singularity is a free, cross-platform and open-source software that can run Operating System Virtualization also known as Containerization. This type of virtualization allows you to run an Operating System within a host Operating System. Hoffman2 has the ability to run containerized software with singularity. This presentation will demonstrate using Singularity on Hoffman2. This presentation will also go over several examples of running containers on Hoffman2 and creating containers to run custom user applications.
